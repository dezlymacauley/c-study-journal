A binary is 8 digits

128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1

0       0       0       0       1       1       0       0

0 x 128 = 0 
0 x 64 = 0 
0 x 32 = 0 
0 x 16 = 0
1 x 8 = 8
1 x 4 = 4
0 x 2 = 0
0 x 1 = 0

    Bitwise AND (&)
    Bitwise OR (|)
    Bitwise XOR (^)
    Bitwise NOT (!)
    Left Shift (<<)
    Right Shift (>>)

These operators work similarly to how they do in C. Here's a brief explanation of each:

    Bitwise AND (&): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
    Bitwise OR (|): Sets each bit to 1 if either of the bits is 1.
    Bitwise XOR (^): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1.
    Bitwise NOT (!): Flips each bit.
    Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
    Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right by a specified number of positions.
