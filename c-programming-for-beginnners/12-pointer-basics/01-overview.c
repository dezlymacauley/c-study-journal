// NOTE: Indirection

// In programming languages indirection is the ability,
// to reference something using a name, reference or container,
// instead of the value itself

// The most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value,
// throught its memory address

// A pointer provides an indirect means,
// of accessing the value of a particular data item:
// - A variable whose value is a memory adddress
// - Its value is the address of another location in memory,
// that can contain a value.
