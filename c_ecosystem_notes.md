C programs end with the extension '.c'

E.g. awesome_program.c

How to run C code:

First install C compiler (Arch Linux):

`sudo pacman -S gcc`

Next you need to compile your code to binary:

`gcc name_of_your_program.c -o what_you_want_the_output_file_to_be_called`

E.g. `gcc awesome_code.c -o awesome_code`

This will create a binary file (On Linux this file has no extension)

To run this binary file:
`./name_of_file`

eg. `./awesome_code`
